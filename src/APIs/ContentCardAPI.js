    desc: `Mahesh Painuly was born and raised in the sacred city of Rishikesh, a place where spirituality meets nature, and every corner has a story to tell. For Mahesh, Rishikesh is not just home; it’s a feeling, a sanctuary, and an endless source of inspiration. From childhood, he felt a deep connection to the city’s vibrant culture, serene landscapes, and the mighty Ganga flowing through its heart.
    This connection became the foundation of his journey—not just as a photographer but as a storyteller who would use his lens to preserve and celebrate the soul of his beloved Rishikesh.`,

    title: `Turning Pain into Purpose`,
    desc: `The year 2013 was a dark time for Uttarakhand. The Kedarnath tragedy devastated countless lives and left deep scars on the state. The internet was flooded with haunting images of destruction, overshadowing the beauty, resilience, and spirit of the region.Mahesh, like every Uttarakhandi, felt the pain deeply. But amidst the despair, he saw a calling. He believed photography could change narratives, rebuild hope, and remind the world of Rishikesh’s enduring beauty and strength. With this belief, Mahesh created the RPC 2013 Photography Competition, inviting photographers across Uttarakhand to capture the true essence of Rishikesh. The competition was not just about pictures; it was a mission to heal the image of a state in mourning. When the stunning images spread across the internet, they sent a powerful message: Rishikesh is safe. Rishikesh is alive. Rishikesh is beautiful.`,

    title: `A Dream Takes Shape`,
    desc: `The overwhelming success of RPC 2013 ignited a fire in Mahesh’s heart. He realized that photography wasn’t just about capturing beauty—it was about building connections, empowering talent, and preserving heritage. In the following months, Mahesh shared his vision with fellow photographers who had participated in the competition. Together, they dreamt of a space where photographers could come together, learn, and showcase their work—a space dedicated to celebrating photography and Rishikesh. On 29th November 2015, that dream became a reality with the first-ever photowalk of the Rishikesh Photography Club (RPC). What started as a small step became the beginning of an incredible journey, one that continues to touch lives and inspire creativity.`,
